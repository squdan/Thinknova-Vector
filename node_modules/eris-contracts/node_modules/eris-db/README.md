# erisdb-js (Alpha)

This is a JavaScript API for communicating with a [ErisDB](https://github.com/eris-ltd/eris-db) server.

## Installation

```shell
$ npm install eris-db
```

## Usage

If you created an ErisDB server using the [Eris CLI](https://github.com/eris-ltd/eris-cli) tool, you can find out its IP address using the following command:

```
$ eris chains inspect <name of ErisDB server> NetworkSettings.IPAddress
```

The main class is `ErisDB`. A standard `ErisDB` instance is created like this:

```
var edbFactory = require('eris-db');

var edb = edbFactory.createInstance("http://<IP address>:1337/rpc");

edb.start(function(error){
    if(!error){
        console.log("Ready to go");
    }
});

```

The parameters for `createInstance` is the server URL as a string. The client-type is chosen based on the URL scheme. As of now, the supported schemes are: `http` and `ws` (websockets). No additional configuration is needed.

If you want to specify what client to use, you do that through the `createInstanceFromClient` method.

```
var edbFactory = require('eris-db');

var wsClient = new edbFactory.clients.WebSocketClient("ws://<IP address>:1337/socketrpc")

var edb = edbFactory.createInstanceFromClient(wsClient);

edb.start(function(error){
    if(!error){
        console.log("Ready to go");
    }
});

```

Clients can be found in `edbFactory.clients`. We currently provide two - `WebSocketClient` and `HTTPClient` + the base classes (`Client` and `TWCClient`) which is only used to implement other protocols.

### HTTP

If you use `http(s)`, the start command will do nothing, so it can just be called and no callback used.

### WebSocket

If you use websocket, the system will not be ready until the start callback fires.

The start callback must be on the following format: `function(error)`.

The websocket-client has a number of additional connection-related methods:

`WebSocketClient.shutDown(callback)` - Technically this method is available in all clients but does not do anything with the http client. If called on an edb instance with a websocket client (or on the client directly), it will invoke the zero-argument callback function when the socket has been terminated.

`WebSocketClient.reconnect(callback)` - Will terminate the current connection (if any), and establish a new one. Same callback as with `start` (`callback(error)`).

`WebSocketClient.setCloseCallback(callback)` - If this zero-argument callback is set, it will be invoked when the active connection is closed. The callback will remain until it is set to `null`. Note that it will also be called when reconnecting if there was an already active connection (since that connection will be closed).

If you want to use several sockets at once (for some reason), you can do that. Just create multiple `ErisDB` instances through `edbFactory.createInstance(...)`.

## API Reference

There are bindings for all the RPC methods. All functions are on the form `function(param1, param2, ... , callback)`, where the callback is a function on the form `function(error,data)` (it is documented under the name `methodCallback`). The `data` object is the same as you would get by calling the corresponding RPC method directly.

This is the over-all structure of the library. The `unsafe` flag means a private key is either sent or received, so should be used with care (dev only). 

NOTE: There will be links to the proper jsdoc and integration with erisindustries.com. For now, the components point to the actual code files and methods points to the web-API method in question.

| Method | RPC method | Notes |
| :----- | :--------- | :---- |
| BlockChain.getInfo |  [erisdb.getBlockchainInfo](https://github.com/eris-ltd/eris-db/blob/master/api.md#getblockchaininfo) | |
| BlockChain.getChainId | [erisdb.getChainId](https://github.com/eris-ltd/eris-db/blob/master/api.md#getchainid) | |

| BlockChain.getBlock | [erisdb.getBlock](https://github.com/eris-ltd/eris-db/blob/master/api.md#getblock) | |

#### Consensus

The consensus object has methods for getting consensus-related data.

| Method | RPC method | Notes |
| :----- | :--------- | :---- |
| Consensus.getState |   [erisdb.getConsensusState](https://github.com/eris-ltd/eris-db/blob/master/api.md#getconsensusstate) | |
| Consensus.getValidators | [erisdb.getValidators](https://github.com/eris-ltd/eris-db/blob/master/api.md#getvalidators) | |

#### Events

The tendermint client will generate and fire off events when important things happen, like when a new block has been committed, or someone is transacting to an account. It is possible to subscribe to these events. These are the methods for subscribing, un-subscribing and polling.

| Method | RPC method | Notes |
| :----- | :--------- | :---- |
| Events.subscribe | [erisdb.eventSubscribe](https://github.com/eris-ltd/eris-db/blob/master/api.md#eventsubscribe) | |
| Events.unsubscribe | [erisdb.eventUnsubscribe](https://github.com/eris-ltd/eris-db/blob/master/api.md#eventunubscribe) | |
| Events.poll | [erisdb.eventPoll](https://github.com/eris-ltd/eris-db/blob/master/api.md#eventpoll) | |

##### Helpers

The helper functions makes it easier to manage subscriptions. Normally you'd be using these functions rather then managing the subscriptions yourself.

Helper functions always contain two callback functions - a `createCallback(error, data)` and an `eventCallback(error, data)`. 

The `createCallback` data is an [EventSub]() object, that can be used to do things like getting the event ID, the subscriber ID, and to stop the subscription. 

The `eventCallback` data is the event object. This object is different depending on the event type. In the case of `NewBlock` it will be a block, the consensus events is a transaction object, etc. More info can be found in the [api doc]().

| Method | Arguments |
| :----- | :-------- |
| Events.subAccountInput | `account address <string>` |
| Events.subAccountOutput | `account address <string>` |
| Events.subAccountReceive | `account address <string>` |
| Events.subLogEvent | `account address <string>` |
| Events.subSolidityEvent | `account address <string>` |
| Events.subNewBlocks | `-` |
| Events.subForks | `-` |
| Events.subBonds | `-` |
| Events.subUnbonds | `-` |
| Events.subRebonds | `-` |
| Events.subDupeouts | `-` |

`subSolidityEvent` and `subLogEvent` are two different names for the same type of subscription (log events).

#### NameReg 

The NameReg object has methods for accessing the name registry.

| Method | RPC method | Notes |
| :----- | :--------- | :---- |
| NameReg.getEntry | [erisdb.getNameRegEntry](https://github.com/eris-ltd/eris-db/blob/master/api.md#get-namereg-entry) | |
| NameReg.getEntries | [erisdb.getNameRegEntries](https://github.com/eris-ltd/eris-db/blob/master/api.md#get-namereg-entries) | |

#### Network

The accounts object has methods for getting network-related data, such as a list of all peers. It could also have been named "node".

Client Version may be a bit misplaced

| Method | RPC method | Notes |
| :----- | :--------- | :---- |
| Network.getInfo | [erisdb.getNetworkInfo](https://github.com/eris-ltd/eris-db/blob/master/api.md#getnetworkinfo) |  |
| Network.getClientVersion | [erisdb.getClientVersion](https://github.com/eris-ltd/eris-db/blob/master/api.md#getclientversion) | |
| Network.getMoniker | [erisdb.getMoniker](https://github.com/eris-ltd/eris-db/blob/master/api.md#getmoniker) | |
| Network.isListening | [erisdb.isListening](https://github.com/eris-ltd/eris-db/blob/master/api.md#islistening) | |
| Network.getListeners | [erisdb.getListeners](https://github.com/eris-ltd/eris-db/blob/master/api.md#getlisteners) | |
| Network.getPeers | [erisdb.getPeers](https://github.com/eris-ltd/eris-db/blob/master/api.md#getpeers) | |
| Network.getPeer | [erisdb.getPeer](https://github.com/eris-ltd/eris-db/blob/master/api.md#getpeer) | |

#### Transactions

A transaction is the equivalence of a database `write` operation. They can be done in two ways. There's the "dev" way, which is to call `transact` and pass along the target address (if any), data, gas, and a private key used for signing. It is very similar to the old Ethereum way of transacting, except Tendermint does not keep accounts in the client, so a private key needs to be sent along. This means the server **should either run on the same machine as the tendermint client, or in the same, private network**.

Transacting via `broadcastTx` will be the standard way of doing things if you want the key to remain on the users machine. This requires a browser plugin for doing the actual signing, which we will add later. For now, you should stick to the `transact` method. 

To get a private key for testing/developing, you can run `tendermint gen_account` if you have it installed. You can also run `tools/pa_generator.js` if you have a local node running. It will take the url as command line argument at some point...

##### Calls

Calls provide read-only access to the smart contracts. It is used mostly to get data out of a contract-accounts storage by using the contracts accessor methods, but can be used to call any method that does not change any data in any account. A trivial example would be a contract function that takes two numbers as input, adds them, and then simply returns the sum. 

There are two types of calls. `Call` takes a data string and an account address and calls the code in that account (if any) using the provided data as input. This is the standard method for read-only operations.

`CallCode` works the same except you don't provide an account address but the actual compiled code instead. It's a dev tool for accessing the VM directly. "Code-execution as a service".

| Method | RPC method | Notes |
| :----- | :--------- | :---- |
| Transactions.broadcastTx | [erisdb.broadcastTx](https://github.com/eris-ltd/eris-db/blob/master/api.md#broadcasttx) | see below |
| Transactions.getUnconfirmedTxs | [erisdb.getUnconfirmedTxs](https://github.com/eris-ltd/eris-db/blob/master/api.md#getunconfirmedtxs) | |
| Transactions.call | [erisdb.call](https://github.com/eris-ltd/eris-db/blob/master/api.md#call) | |
| Transactions.callCode | [erisdb.callCode](https://github.com/eris-ltd/eris-db/blob/master/api.md#callcode) | |
| Transactions.transact | [erisdb.transact](https://github.com/eris-ltd/eris-db/blob/master/api.md#transact) | unsafe |
| Transactions.transactAndHold | [erisdb.transactAndHold](https://github.com/eris-ltd/eris-db/blob/master/api.md#transact-and-hold) | unsafe |
| Transactions.transactNameReg | [erisdb.transactNameReg](https://github.com/eris-ltd/eris-db/blob/master/api.md#transactnamereg) | unsafe |

`broadcastTx` is useless until we add a client-side signing solution.
